== Quick start ==

This project, xmpp-notify, is a work-in-progress. This might help you
getting started:

First, clone repository:
 git clone git://github.com/koenbollen/xmpp-notify.git
 cd xmpp-notify

Then copy configuration to the local user and edit it:
 cp xmpp-notify.cfg ~/.xmpp-notify.py
 vi ~/.xmpp-notify.py
note: at least supply: target, host, domain, username & password

Run the server in verbose mode:
 ./scripts/xmpp-notify-server -v

And (in another terminal) send requests:
 ./scripts/xmpp-notify-client Hello, XMPP
 curl -d "data=Updates" http://localhost:5222/1/notify


This will install install the application and check the permissions:
 sudo python setup.py install
 sudo chmod 0600 /etc/xmpp-notify.cfg     << edit this
